# Introduction to Python

## Review of Git Terminology

- In the last assignment, how did the class copy, your fork, and your local copy of the repository relate to each other?
- If you draw arrows connecting the copies, can you label these arrows with the git "verbs" - _fork_, _clone_, _push_, and _pull_ request?
- What's the difference between forking or cloning and branching?
- What are the two ways we can use the _checkout_ command?

## Reading

As a reminder, keeping up with reading in the Practical Computing book (or other outside resources) can provided valuable added perspective about the topics we are covering. For this week, please review chapters 7 and 8. Additional resources are linked below.

## What is Python?

- Interpreted, high-level language
- Very popular among computational biologists
- One of the most "human readable" programming languages
- One of the few languages where line indentation is actually interpreted as part of the code
- Python is _much_ less picky than bash about spacing within lines, though
- Dynamically typed (we'll get to this later)

## Python Interpreter and Jupyter Notebooks

- Unlike many programming languages (e.g., C++ and Java), Python can be executed interactively
- To start the Python interpreter, simply open up a Terminal window and execute these commands
    - `python`
    - `a = 3`
    - `a`
